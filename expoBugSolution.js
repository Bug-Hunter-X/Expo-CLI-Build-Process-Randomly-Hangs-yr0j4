Several workarounds might resolve the hanging build issue:

1. **Check Network Connection:** Ensure stable internet connectivity throughout the build process. 
2. **Clear Expo Cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo cache and attempt the build again. 
3. **Update Dependencies:** Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update all project dependencies. Pay close attention to any Expo modules that might be causing conflicts.
4. **Rebuild Project:** Create a fresh project and manually transfer the essential code to rule out potential project-level issues. 
5. **Check Expo Server Status:** Verify that the Expo servers are working correctly by checking the Expo status page. 
6. **Simplify the Project:** Temporarily remove non-essential modules and plugins to isolate the cause if the problem still exists. 
7. **Debug with Logs:** Add detailed logs to the project to better monitor the build steps and pinpoint which part is causing the hang.
